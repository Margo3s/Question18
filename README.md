# Question18

 ### **Problem Statement**:
 **You should train a classifier that is able to predict in which regime the bubbles are:**
- [x] Evaluate the classifier with the metrics that you consider appropriate.
- [x] Plot the decision boundaries of the classifier.

 ### **Sources**
 The master branch is composed by:
* Data : CVS files contain the Eötvös and Galilei numbers for different simulations of rising bubbles.
* Main : To run the project and obtain the prediction, the classifier evaluation and the Plot of decision Boundaries
* Functions : Functions for Data Preprocessing, Model Prediction and Data Visualization
* Packages : Libraries and Modules import

 ### **Solution**
- [x] Data input
- [x] Data Preprocessing (log10)
- [x] Model Selection

Model | Kernel | 
------|--------|
Support Vector Machine | Radial basis function 

- [x] Model Train
- [x] Model Prediction
- [x] Prediction Results ( Accuracy and Confussion Matrix)

Precision | Recall |  F1-Score| Accuracy
------|--------|----------|---------
0.86 | 0.81 | 0.81 |0.81
 
- [x] Data Visualization ( Decision Boundaries Plot)
